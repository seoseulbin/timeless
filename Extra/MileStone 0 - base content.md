스프라이트의 회전과 스케일링의 과정을 통해, 플레이어에게 조금 더 직관적으로 현재의 패턴타일의 상황을 알려줄 수 있다.
Through the process of rotating and scaling the sprite, it is possible to inform the player more intuitively about the current situation of the pattern tile.


여러 레벨과 패턴들이 생성되는 과정을 통해, 단순한 패턴으로 인해 플레이어가 지루해 질 때쯤, 더 복잡하고, 더 빠른 패턴들이 등장함으로 인해, 조금 더 긴장감과 속도감을 불어 넣어 유저들이 재미를 느끼게 한다.
Through the process of creating multiple levels and patterns, by the time the player becomes bored due to simple patterns, more complex and faster patterns appear, creating a little more tension and speed, which makes users have fun.


스테이지가 증가함에 따라 커지는 맵 규모와 많아지는 패턴타일들의 모든 것들을 코드 내부에 담으면 용량이 비약적으로 커지기 때문에 모든 스테이지들을 외부에서 불러와 게임 내부에서 읽음으로써 더 많은 메모리 확보하며 추후에 플레이어들이 스테이지를 제작함에 있어서도 편리하다고 판단했다.
As the stage increases, the size of the map and pattern tiles that increase inside the code increases the capacity dramatically, so all stagees are called from external and read inside the game to secure more memory, and it is also convenient for players to produce stages later.
